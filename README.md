# BooleanTumorGrowthKinetics
Here one can find scripts about boolean network inference, cellular automata and image analysis, concerning to article preprint 
"Network Inference from Cancer and Epithelial Cell Co-Culture Reveal Microenvironmental Configurations That Drives Population Dynamics"
doi: doi: 10.20944/preprints202310.1530.v2


# Python scripts
All scripts are fully comented. To run cellular automata simulation one shall run the script inputData.py
The iKM_notebook.ipyb contain the algoritm adapted from Berestovsky et al 2013 to binarize time serie through iterative k-means.

# R scripts
data_timepoint.R read the cell count per time point and generate the time serie present in Morais et al 2017
as csv file

setData.R read the csv file generated by data_timepoints and convert to a data frame in order to binarize time serie through 
functions inside package BoolNet and Binarize.

binLearn.R binarize time serie according kmeans and BASC, generate a consensus of iterative k-means and learn boolean network
