# BooleanTumorGrowthKinetics
Here one can find scripts about boolean network inference, cellular automata and image analysis, concerning to article preprint 
"Network Inference from Cancer and Epithelial Cell Co-Culture Reveal Microenvironmental Configurations That Drives Population Dynamics"
doi: 10.20944/preprints202310.1530.v1 


# Python scripts
All scripts are fully comented. To run cellular automata simulation one shall run the script inputData.py
The iKM_notebook.ipyb contain the algoritm adapted from Berestovsky et al 2013 to binarize time serie through iterative k-means.
